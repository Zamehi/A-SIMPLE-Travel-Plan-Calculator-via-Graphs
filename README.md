# A-SIMPLE-Travel-Plan-Calculator-via-Graphs
You have been given an Excel file (GraphData.xlsx) which is an adjacency-matrix representation of a
weighted graph of different cities of Pakistan. Each cell of adjacency-matrix has some non-negative
number which is distance from one city to other adjacent city if a road(s) segment(s) does exist.
Otherwise, there will be zero (0) which means no edge/road-link does exist.


Features/Options to be Supported
1. Create graph data structure using the given input. Your application should have the option/feature
to add new city/node, add new edge/road-link, drop a city/node, drop an existing edge/road-link
etc. 
2. Option/feature for computing Shortest and Alternate (2nd shortest) paths from a city chosen by the
user to all other cities (given in graph). Output should be displayed in the form of a list/sequence of
city/cities names to be visited while travelling on shortest/alternate path from a specified city to
other cities. The same output may be displayed in graphical/map form. Shortest and Alternate paths
should be displayed at once. 
3. Option/feature for computing Shortest and Alternate (2nd shortest) paths from all cities to a
specified/given city (selection/input to be given by the user). Output should be in the form as
mentioned above (Option / Sr. # 2). 
4. Option/feature for computing Shortest and Alternate (2nd shortest) paths from a pair of cities
chosen (e.g. Islamabad to Lahore) by the user. Output should be in the form as mentioned above
(Option / Sr. # 2).
